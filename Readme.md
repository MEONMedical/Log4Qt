        qmake
        msbuild Log4Qt.sln
        msbuild /t:INSTALL Log4Qt.sln

    For static build call qmake with
    qmake "DEFINES+=LOG4QT_STATIC" or uncommend LOG4QT_STATIC in the build.pri file
    Don't forget to define LOG4QT_STATIC also in your project.

    Logging to a database via databaseappender can be enabled with qmake "QT += sql"
