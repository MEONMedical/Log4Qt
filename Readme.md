Description
-----------
Log4Qt is a C++ port of the Apache Software Foundation Log4j package using the Qt Framework.
It is intended to be used by open source and commercial Qt projects.

Original project
----------------
http://log4qt.sourceforge.net/

This Log4Qt repository is a clone of the Log4Qt repository from https://gitorious.org/log4qt
which was itself a clone of the original Log4Qt project on SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4qt/ (http://log4qt.sourceforge.net/).

Additional features
-------------------
* SimpleTimeLayout (“dd.MM.yyyy hh:mm [Thread] Level Logger Message”)
* ColorConsoleAppender (render colorized message by escape sequence and put it to console)
* SignalAppender (emit signal when log event happens)
* DatabaseAppender (append log event into sql table)
* DatabaseLayout (put log event into sql table columns)
* Telnet appender (append log event to telnet clients)
* LogStream (qDebug()-style log messages appending)
* MainThreadAppender (Proxy appender for sending log messages through event loop)
* XMLLayout to support apache chainsaw
* DailyFileAppender which generates a logfile for each day (add current date formatted to the filename)
* Binary logger
* Windows Debug Console Appender

Requirements
------------
* Minimum Qt version required Qt5.12 (for support of Qt versions down to 5.3 use branch 1.4 or the lates 1.4.x release
  or for support of Qt versions down to 5.7 use branch 1.5 or the lates 1.5.x release)
* C++11 feature required (minimum compiler version MSVC14, GCC 4.8 or CLANG 3.3)

Clone
-----
    git clone https://github.com/MEONMedical/Log4Qt.git

Build and install
-----------------
### qmake
use qmake to build the project

    *NIX
        qmake
        make
        make install

    WIN* (mingw)
        qmake
        mingw32-make
        mingw32-make install

    WIN* (msvc)
        qmake
        msbuild Log4Qt.sln
        msbuild /t:INSTALL Log4Qt.sln

    For static build call qmake with
    qmake "DEFINES+=LOG4QT_STATIC" or uncommend LOG4QT_STATIC in the build.pri file
    Don't forget to define LOG4QT_STATIC also in your project.

    Logging to a database via databaseappender can be enabled with qmake "QT += sql"

### include in your project
Can also be used by adding the log4qt source directly to your Qt project file by adding the following line:
include(<unpackdir>/src/log4qt/log4qt.pri)

### cmake
cmake is the second option to build Log4Qt. An out-of-source build is required:
    <unpack/fetch to Log4Qt directory>
    mkdir Log4Qt-build
    cd Log4Qt-build
    cmake ../Log4Qt
    make/mingw32-make/msbuild Log4Qt.sln (same as with qmake)
    make/mingw32-make install
    or:
    msbuild /t:INSTALL Log4Qt.sln

    Addition cmake options are
        * '-DBUILD_STATIC_LOG4CXX_LIB=ON|OFF' to build static log4qt lib (default: OFF)
        * '-DBUILD_WITH_DB_LOGGING=ON|OFF' to build with database logging support
